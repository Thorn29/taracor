[Note: Since April 2022. the original website (http://taracor.net) has been shut down, and due to the owners' personal problems, business has been put on hold. The link above leads to a temporary live preview of the site, for portfolio purposes, until the original is restored]

## Development

Originally developed in early 2020, the website uses **GatsbyJS** to display various services the company offers, and the images use advanced processing and loading techniques thanks to *gatsby-image* plugin and **GraphQL** queries. The project also uses *CSS Modules* so all the CSS data is scoped locally.
